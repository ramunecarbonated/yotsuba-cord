# yotsuba-cord

Add some 4chan flavour to your Discord client, unfinished and a work in progress. Only changes the "chat" part in your Discord client to look more like a thread on 4chan.

## Usage / Installation

```
@import url("https://rawgit.com/ramunecarbonated/yotsuba-cord/master/yotsuba.css");
```
The CSS comes with settings for `Tomorrow` (default), `Yotsuba Blue`, `Yotsuba Purple` and `Yotsuba`. Because of the structuring of the repository and there being only one CSS file (SASS -> CSS compile with src / dist folders are planned, along with some other things) the only available color scheme currently is `Tomorrow`, which is a dark/night style skin.

For learning on how to use load CSS files inside Discord: this is not the place.

## Things to keep in mind

- This theme can break if Discord has an update. This is minimalised by using CSS3 selectors, but it would be pretty boring if stuff did not break once in a while, wouldn't it?
- No consistent plans on updating this theme, but issue reports and feedbacks are welcomed.
